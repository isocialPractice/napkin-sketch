/**
 * TODO.md maintenance.
 *
 * Moves every checked top-level item (`- [x] ...`, together with its wrapped
 * continuation lines and nested sub-items) out of its roadmap section and
 * into a `## Complete` section, which is created on first use and always
 * kept at the bottom of the file. Each archived item gains a nested
 * `- From: <section>` line recording which roadmap section it came from -
 * unless the item already carries a `- From:` note (an item worked on under
 * Current keeps the section it originally came from), which is preserved.
 * Items already under `## Complete` stay where they are, so running the
 * script repeatedly is a no-op.
 *
 * Nested checked items under an unchecked parent are left in place - the
 * parent keeps its context until it is checked off as a whole.
 *
 *   npm run todo
 *   node scripts/todo.mjs
